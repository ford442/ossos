Degree of arc between two points
- Angle in radians = 2 * arcsin( Distance / ( 2 * Radius ) )

If the two points are the center of the circle with a Distance of 10 with a radius of 5
It should return a value of 180, which is a straight line OR half a circle.

If the distance gets smaller, the arc will get smaller but we want to expand the half circle
to a full circle. So (180-arc) + 180 should give you the circle arc of more then half.
