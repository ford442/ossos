GOOD EXAMPLE OF CCD WITH CONSTRAINTS

REALLY GOOD ORTHO NORMALZING AN AXIS
This spreads the error across three directions to compute the average axes
This might be very useful in situations with IK

Wierd Interactions between points

Recompute the position & rotation of various points
in relation to its change from its original. Great for
Rigid body stuff. Plus it has a nice particle sim of holding
its shape while still dropping to the floor.

Great examples of segments, even a setup to control a plane
